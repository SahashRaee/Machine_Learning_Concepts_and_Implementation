## HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS

* ...........?
* Number system: **2500 Years ago**
  * 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
  * 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B
  * 0 1 

* Logical Reasoning: Language and Logics
  * If **A**, then **B** (if $x^2$ is even, then x is even)
  * if not **B**, then not **A** (If x is not even, then $x^2$ is not even)
* Euclidean Algorithm: **2000 years ago**
  * **The Elements**: The most influential book of all-time
  * Greatest Common Divisor of 2 numbers: **GCD(1054, 714)**
  * **Cryptography** (Encryption and Decryption)
* $\pi$ and Geometry (About $5^{th}$ Century)
  * Pythagoras Theorem
    * Metcalfe's Law
      * Suppose, Weight of network is $n^2$ then,
        * **Network of 50M  = Network of 40M + Network of 30M** 
    * Input Analysis
      * Some programs with n inputs take $n^2$ time to run (Bubble Sort). In terms of processing time: **50 inputs = 40 inputs + 30 inputs**
    * Surface Area
      * **Area of radius 50 =  Area of radius 40 + Area of radius 30**
    * Physics
      * The KE of an object with mass(m) and velocity(v) is **$1/2mv^2$**. In terms of energy:
        * **Energy at 500 mph =  Energy at 400 mph + Energy at 300 mph**
        * With the energy used to accelerate one bullet to 500 mph, we could accelerate two others to 400 mph and 300 mph
  * Logarithms and Algebra
      | | Logarithms = Time| Exponents = Growth |
      |-|:------------------:|:--------------------:|
      |Time/ Growth Perspective| $ln(x)$ <br> Time needed to grow to x <br> (with 100% continuous compounding) |$e^x$ <br> Amount of growth after time x <br> (with 100% continuous compounding)|
   * Radius of earth was calcutated using basic Geometry, deductive reasoning and just measuring the shadow length
   * Cartesian Co-ordinates
   * Complex Numbers
   * Euler'ss Formula: **$17^{th} Century$**
   * Calculus
     * Math and Physics changed forever
     * Rate of Change, slope
     * Algebra, Rate of speed
     * Calculus, Exact speed at any time
     * Radar reads the real time of Aeroplane
     * Motion of planet: How they change their speed throughout the orbit?
     * Chemistry: Diffusion rates
     * Biology
    * **In 1736: Euler** Published a paper
      * Seven Bridges of Konigsberg
        * $1^{st} paper of graph theory$
        * Can you cross each bridge exactly once?
        * Google 
        * Facebook
    * **In 1822**: J. Fourier
      * Heat Flow
      * Fourier Series
      * Fourier Transform
    * Group Theory
      * Symmetry Analysis (Chemistry)
    * Boolean Algebra
    * Set Theory
    * Probability and statistics
    * Permutation and Combination
    * **In 1990**: Game Theory, Chaos Theory (Butterfly Effect)
      * Game Theory: The Science of Decision Making
      * Mathematics and Decision: Social Interactions
      * 1950, **John Nash**
      * A game is any interaction between multiple people in which each person's **payoff** is affected by the decisions made by others
      * Did you interact with anyone today?
        * You can probably analyze the decisions you made using game theory
      * Economics, Political Science, Biology, Military, Psychology, **Computer Science**, Mathematics, Physics
      * Non-cooperative (Competitive) and Cooperative Game Theory
      * Game Theory: Non-cooperative (Competitive) 
        * It covers competitive social interactions where there will be some winners and some losers
        * The Prisoner's Dilemma

          | ------------ | ------------- | ---------- |
          | No Confession | 3 Years - 3 Years |  Shyam (10 Yrs) - Hari Free |
          | Confession | Shyam(Free) - Hari (10 Yrs) | 5 years - 5 Years |
        * Optimal Solution ..........?
      * The Turing Test
        * In the 19550s, Alan Turing created Turing Test which is used to determine the level of intelligence of a computer
      * Controversy of Turing Test
        * Some people disagree with the Turing Test. They claim it does not actually measure a computer's intelligence
        * Instead of coming up with a response themselves, they can use the same generic phrases to pass the test

## ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

* Thinking
  * It must have sth to do with thinking
* Thinking, Perception & Action
  * Philosophy: We would love to talk about problems involving thinking, perception & action
  * Computer Science: We will talk about models that are targeted at thinking, perception & action  
* Models (Models of thinking)
  * Differential Equations, Probability Functions, Physical & Computational Simulations

Note: We need to build models in order to explain the past, predict the future, understand the subject matter and control the world… **THAT'S WHAT THIS SUBJECT IS ALL ABOUT**

## REPRESENTATIONS STRATEGIES 

* Representations that support models targeted at thinking, perception & action
* What is “Representation”?
  * River Crossing Puzzle (Farmer, Tiger, Goat, Grass)

  * What would be the right representation of this problem?
    * Picture of the Farmer?
    * Poem of the situation? (Haiku, Story…?)
  * As we know: The right representation must involve sth about the location of the participants in this scenario…! 
  * Representation Solution

  * Representation Strategies & Constraints
  * General mathematics exposes constraints
  * AI is constraints exposed by representation that supports models targeted to thinking... but….?
  * **According to Dr. Winston (Professor, Computer Scientist, MIT)** - AI is all about algorithms enabled by constraints exposed by representations that supports models targeted thinking, perception & action…!
